        <h1>Top AI Note‑Taking Tools: Notta vs&nbsp;Otter AI</h1>
        <p>Keeping accurate meeting notes is essential for remote teams. AI transcription tools can save hours every week, but choosing the right one can be tricky. In this post we compare two of the most popular options—Notta and Otter AI—to help you decide which fits your workflow.</p>
        <h2>Notta: Versatile and Multi‑Language</h2>
        <p>Notta offers <strong>real‑time automated transcription</strong> and can even <strong>auto‑join meetings</strong> on Zoom, Google&nbsp;Meet and Microsoft&nbsp;Teams【950293254953508†L310-L401】. A standout feature is its support for <strong>58&nbsp;languages</strong>, making it a great choice for international teams. Notta transcribes uploaded audio and video files and generates AI‑powered summaries and task lists【950293254953508†L310-L401】. You can export transcripts to Notion, Slack or in text and PDF formats.</p>
        <p>Other handy features include noise reduction, speaker identification and keyword highlighting. Notta’s web and mobile apps sync your recordings across devices. Pricing is competitive, and there’s a free plan with limited minutes.</p>
        <h2>Otter AI: Collaborative and Real‑Time</h2>
        <p>Otter AI also provides real‑time transcription, but it emphasises collaboration. Team members can highlight text, add comments and assign action items directly within the transcript【950293254953508†L430-L460】. Otter’s AI generates concise summaries and attempts to identify different speakers, which is useful for cross‑functional meetings【950293254953508†L430-L460】.</p>
        <p>Otter has mobile apps and integrates with major video conferencing platforms. It doesn’t support as many languages as Notta, but for English‑speaking teams looking for collaboration features, it remains a solid choice.</p>
        <h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2>
        <p>If you need multi‑language support, advanced summaries and integration with tools like Notion and Slack, Notta is hard to beat. If your priority is collaborative note‑taking where teammates can comment and assign tasks directly, Otter AI may be a better fit. Both offer free trials, so test them with your team to see which improves your workflow.</p>
